**Explanation of the Code:**

1.  **Import Libraries:** Imports `qrcode`, `os` (for path manipulation like checking extensions), and `Image` from `PIL` (Pillow).
2.  **`generate_qr_code` Function:**
    *   Takes `data`, `filename`, and optional QR parameters as input.
    *   Includes basic validation (checks if `data` is provided).
    *   Ensures the filename ends with a common image extension, defaulting to `.png`.
    *   Sets up the `qrcode.QRCode` object with specified or default parameters (version, error correction, box size, border). `version=None` is generally best as it lets the library pick the smallest size needed.
    *   Adds the user's data using `qr.add_data()`.
    *   Finalizes the QR structure with `qr.make(fit=True)`.
    *   Creates the image object using `qr.make_image()`.
    *   Saves the image using `img.save()`.
    *   Includes `try...except` blocks to handle potential errors like file saving issues or other exceptions during generation.
    *   Prints success or error messages.
3.  **`if __name__ == "__main__":` Block:**
    *   This code runs only when the script is executed directly.
    *   It prints a simple title.
    *   Uses `input()` to get the data and optional filename from the user.
    *   Sets a default filename if the user doesn't provide one.
    *   Calls the `generate_qr_code` function to perform the main task.

Now you have the script, the necessary requirements file, and instructions ready for your GitHub repository!
